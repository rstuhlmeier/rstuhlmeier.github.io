	<p>            	I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Faculty of <a href="http://cee.technion.ac.il/">Civil & Environmental Engineering</a> at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, working on wave-power harvesting in the open ocean. 
<br> Prior to that I completed a PhD in mathematics at the University of Vienna, working on gravity water waves from the perspective of the incompressible Euler equations. <br>
            Broadly speaking, my interests include ocean surface waves, among them tsunami, stratified-density flows, and waves with vorticity (in particular Gerstner's wave).</p>
