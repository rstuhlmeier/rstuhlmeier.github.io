<h2>Nonlinear wave-wave interaction in deep water</h2>
For weakly nonlinear waves, nonlinear interaction appears with quadratic nonlinearities in shallow water, and cubic nonlinearities in deep-water. 
Such nonlinearities are responsible, for example, for the amplitude-dependent change in wave celerity found by Stokes in the mid 19th century.
Since work by Phillips and others, the role of nonlinear resonant and near-resonant interactions has become appreciated as a major factor in the dynamics of ocean surface waves.
