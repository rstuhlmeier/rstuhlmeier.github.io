<h1> Linear Algebra (and Complex Numbers) </h1>



During the fall semester 2018 I taught the first half of a one semester course in Linear Algebra & Complex Numbers for first year mathematics students at the University of Plymouth. 


<p> 
The material in this course was based largely on the book
<ul>
<li>Strang, Gilbert, Introduction to Linear Algebra, 5th edition.</li>
</ul>
Most of the material associated with the book is available through <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/">MIT OCW</a> or the book's <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">website</a>. I did solve a selection of problems in some detail, and provide these here for teaching or learning.
