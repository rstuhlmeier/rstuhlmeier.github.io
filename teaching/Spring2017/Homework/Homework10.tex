This homework does not need to be handed in. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $h>0.$ Solve the problem
\begin{align*}
& u_t - u_{xx} + hu = 0, \, 0 < x < \pi, \, t > 0 \\
& u(0,t) = 0, \, u(\pi,t) = 1, \, t \geq 0 \\
& u(x,0) = 0, \, 0 \leq x \leq \pi
\end{align*}
Is the solution classical? (Recall from class what you need to check!)
\item  Solve the problem
\begin{align*}
& u_t - u_{xx} = 2t + (9t + 31) \sin(3x/2), \, 0 < x < \pi, \, t > 0 \\
& u(0,t) = t^2, \, u_x(\pi,t) = 1, \, t \geq 0 \\
& u(x,0) = x+3\pi, \, 0 \leq x \leq \pi
\end{align*}
Is the solution classical?
\item Let $u(x,t)$ be a solution of the problem
\begin{align*}
& u_t - u_{xx} = 0, \, Q_T = \{ (x,t) \mid 0 < x < \pi, \, 0 < t \leq T \} \\
& u(0,t) =  u(\pi,t) = 0, \, 0\leq t \leq T \\
& u(x,0) = \sin^2(x), \, 0 \leq x \leq \pi
\end{align*}
Use the maximum principle to prove that $0 \leq u(x,t) \leq e^{-t} \sin(x)$ in the rectangle $Q_T.$
\item Consider the equation 
\begin{align*}
& u_t - u_{xx} = 0, \, 0 < x < 1, t > 0\\
& u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0 \\
& u(x,0) = 4x(1-x)
\end{align*}
(a) Show that $0 < u(x,t) < 1$ for all $t>0$ and $x \in (0,1).$ (b) Show that $u(x,t) = u(1-x,t)$ for all $t \geq 0$ and $0 \leq x \leq 1.$ (c) Use the energy method to show that $\int_0^1 u^2 dx$ is a strictly decreasing function of $t.$
\item Show that the maximum principle is not true for the equation $u_t = xu_{xx}$ with a variable coefficient. First verify that $u(x,t) = -2xt - x^2$ is a solution. Find the location of its maximum in the closed rectangle $\{-x \leq x \leq 2, \, 0 \leq t \leq 1\}.$
 \end{enumerate}
