<h1>TAU-Technion Water Waves Seminar </h1>
            <p>
            During the winter term 2015/2016 I organized (jointly with G. Hendin of Tel Aviv University) a regular seminar on water wave theory. Providing a forum for discussion and exchange among young researchers in the field of water waves from Technion and Tel Aviv University, we held a series of meetings on experimental and theoretical aspects of water waves and related topics. </p>
            <p> During the coming summer term, we intend to continue the seminar in the form of full-day workshops, starting at the Technion. The dates and speakers will be determined in due course. If you are interested in participating or contributing, or would like to be updated about future meetings, please <a href="mailto:raphaels@tx.technion.ac.il">contact me.</a>
