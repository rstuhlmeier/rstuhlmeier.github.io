For the following differential problems, proceed in steps: a) determine the order and whether the equation is linear/nonlinear. b) select a method from the ones you have learned. c) solve the equation/IVP. d) check your answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $2t \sin(y) + y^3 e^t + (t^2 \cos(y) + 3y^2 e^t) y' = 0 $
\item $y' + y = 5 \sin(2t)$
\item $y' = (\cos^2(x))(\cos^2(2y))$
\item $2y' + y = 3t^2$
\item $2x + 3 + (2y-2) y' = 0$
\item $y' -4y = e^{4t}, \quad y(0) = 2$
\end{enumerate}
