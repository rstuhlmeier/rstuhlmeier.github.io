<h1> Ordinary Differential Equations - Problem Class </h1>



During the fall semester 2016 I taught exercise classes in Ordinary Differential Equations for students of Civil and Chemical Engineering at Technion's International School. 
            Students may find all relevant material on the <a href="https://moodle.technion.ac.il/course/view.php?id=2243">moodle</a>.


<p> 
The material in this course was based largely on the book
<ul>
<li>Boyce, William E., and Richard C. DiPrima. "Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems." (2001).</li>
</ul>
Below are a number of assignments and problem sets (PDF/TEX Source).
