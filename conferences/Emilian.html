<h2>Water waves under ice and related phenomena</h2>
<h3><a href="https://people.uea.ac.uk/e_parau">Emilian Parau</a></h3>
<h3>Professor of Applied Mathematics, School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia</h3>


<p>
In this talk I will present some computational, analytical and experimental results for waves propagating under a continuous or broken ice plate. The ice plate is modelled as an elastic or viscoelastic thin shell. The incompressible and inviscid fluids under ice is assumed to be either homogenous or stratified.

Waves generated by moving loads, solitary waves and internal waves will be discussed.
