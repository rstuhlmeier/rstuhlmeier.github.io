<h2>Advice for an applied math talk</h2>
from L N Trefethen FRS
<ol>
<li>  Begin with a thorough discussion of your Table of Contents. This will help the audience follow your presentation.</li>
<li>  Aim for about three slides per minute. For example, 72 slides is good for a 25-minute talk.</li>
<li>  Report error estimates and computer timings to at least six digits of accuracy. For example, it’s more precise to say you got an error of 3.22005e-8 in 5.52723 seconds than 3.2e-8 in 5.5 seconds.</li>
<li>  Present numbers, not plots. Plots leave a vague and fuzzy impression.</li>
<li>  Be sure to give details of the proofs. A proof without details isn’t rigorous.</li>
<li> Aim the laser at the screen and wave it around the part of the slide you’re talking about. This helps the audience pay attention.</li>
<li> As your time slot nears its end, speed up if necessary. Don’t risk failing to cover all your material.</li>
