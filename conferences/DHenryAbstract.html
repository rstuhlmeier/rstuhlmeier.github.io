<h2>Flow Underlying Coupled Surface and Internal Water Waves </h2>
<h3>David Henry (University College Cork)</h3>

<p>
  Abstract: Determining the underlying fluid motion generated by a wave propagating on an interface is an intriguing area of mathematical research which has important practical implications. In this talk I present recent results concerning the fluid motion induced by internal water waves, coupled with surface waves, in the linear setting for two irrotational fluid layers. A detailed qualitative description of the underlying wave-field kinematics is achieved using a phase-plane analysis, which is dependent on a variety of physical-flow parameters. As a by-product we elucidate the fluid particle trajectory patterns for a range of coupled wave motions.
